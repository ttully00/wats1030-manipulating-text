The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Enviroment (1984) b Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, no
single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to
programming, a philosophy of using the computer. although that philosophy can't be written
down in a single sentence, at its the idea that the power of a system comes more from
the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. many UNIX programs
do quite trivial things in solation, but, combined with other programs, become general and
useful tools.
